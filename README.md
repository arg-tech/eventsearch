# ArgSearch

This runs as a stripped down version of OVA and works purely as a user interface seperately from the underlying knowledge repository. 

In a local version two main parts will need to be changed in the code to ensure the search functionality still works. 

The URL specified here: <form method="GET" action="http://www.aifdb.org/search" id="textsearch"> within index.php will need to point to a local install of AIFdb.
